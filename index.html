arrdata = [["JackLondon","Buck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor did he attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought forward. But he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling with bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so as to dodge it if thrown by Francois, for he was become wise in the way of clubs."
],["JackLondon","The driver went about his work, and he called to Buck when he was ready to put him in his old place in front of Dave. Buck retreated two or three steps. Francois followed him up, whereupon he again retreated. After some time of this, Francois threw down the club, thinking that Buck feared a thrashing. But Buck was in open revolt. He wanted, not to escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. It was his by right. He had earned it, and he would not be content with less."
],["JackLondon","Perrault took a hand. Between them they ran him about for the better part of an hour. They threw clubs at him. He dodged. They cursed him, and his fathers and mothers before him, and all his seed to come after him down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his body and drop of blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of their reach. He did not try to run away, but retreated around and around the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met, he would come in and be good."
],["JackLondon","Francois sat down and scratched his head. Perrault looked at his watch and swore. Time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an hour gone. Francois scratched his head again. He shook it and grinned sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they were beaten. Then Francois went up to where Sol-leks stood and called to Buck. Buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. Francois unfastened Sol-leks's traces and put him back in his old place. The team stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the trail. There was no place for Buck save at the front. Once more Francois called, and once more Buck laughed and kept away."
],["Wikipedia","With Hagrid's help, Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: Ron Weasley, a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a gifted and very hardworking witch of non-magical parentage. Harry also encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a deep and abiding dislike for him, and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who later turns out to be controlled by Lord Voldemort. The plot concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who in his quest for immortality, yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life."
],["Wikipedia","The third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, follows Harry in his third year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort. Instead, Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by Sirius Black, an escaped mass murderer believed to have assisted in the deaths of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors—dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul—which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age. Harry came to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, Peter Pettigrew."
],["Wikipedia","Stanley Lambchop and his younger brother Arthur are given a big bulletin board by their father to display pictures and posters. He hangs it on the wall over Stanley's bed. During the night the board falls from the wall, flattening Stanley in his sleep. He survives and makes the best of his altered state, and soon he is entering locked rooms by sliding under the door, and playing with his younger brother by being used as a kite. One special advantage is that Flat Stanley can now visit his friends by being mailed in an envelope. Stanley even helps catch some art museum thieves by posing as a painting on the wall. Eventually, Stanley is tired of being flat and Arthur changes him back to his proper shape with a bicycle pump."
],["Wikipedia","Angel has been on primetime television for more hours than any other magician in history, between his television series and various specials on cable and network television. He also holds multiple world-records made during his magic performances, and was named Magician of the Decade in 2009 and Magician of the Century in 2010 by the International Magicians Society. In addition to his career as an illusionist, Angel was the lead singer for his eponymous industrial band Angeldust, which released five albums between 1998 and 2003. He also authored the book Mindfreak: Secret Revelations."
],["CNN","You all would have liked my father. Pa worked in a furniture factory all day and drove a cab on weekends. A few nights a week, he worked as a janitor at the Catholic school near our apartment. Back then, the public schools in our South Side Chicago neighborhood were dangerous, and mopping floors became his way of paying tuition for me and my five brothers and sisters. When he did have an evening off, Pa had a ritual. He'd walk in the door, change into his slippers, eat a clove of garlic (good for the heart), drink a shot of tequila, bite into a lime, then sit down in his La-Z-Boy to watch the evening news. Before he could get comfortable, Pa would have to examine every bill that came in that day. We stacked them on the folding table next to his chair, and he paid them immediately."
],["CNN","In July, authorities raided Jared Fogle's home and confiscated electronic equipment -- part of a broader investigation into the case of Russell Taylor, who had been executive director of the Jared Foundation, and was arrested for child pornography in May. At the time, federal authorities made it clear that Fogle was not under investigation. Clearly, that position changed. According to U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler, Fogle has been involved in a 'five-year criminal scheme to exploit children.' The famed former Subway pitchman is expected to plead guilty to child pornography charges and crossing state lines to pay for sex with minors. As part of his plea deal, Fogle will likely serve between five and 12½ years in prison."
],["CNN","Donald Trump does not make mistakes, as he is unafraid to tell you: 'Every time they say I make a mistake, my poll numbers go up,' he told reporters in Iowa. Trump informs us he does not ask God for forgiveness. After all, God hasn't asked Trump for the same. Desperate people do desperate things, however, and the American people despair their country is failing. Many Republican primary voters and caucus goers, meanwhile, believe they need a manly disciplinarian more than another pliable GOP leader. They are tired of their party's flaccid incrementalism and think only bold action can save their country, teetering on a ledge. That bold action comes in the person of Trump, whose New Hampshire town hall Wednesday night was a masterful piece of performance art, unduplicated by any Republican since Ronald Reagan."
],["CNN","Former President Jimmy Carter's personality was on full display at his courageous and somber press conference. His commitment to his family and devotion to his work, and his willingness to talk in a direct way about almost anything, including his health, reflects the kind of person he has always been. His optimism and calm in the face of difficult challenges is also classic Carter. The conference marked the end of an important era in presidential politics. In his remarks to reporters, Carter made it clear that as a result of his battle with cancer he will pull back from many of his involvements at the Carter Center so that he can undergo the necessary treatment. Joking that he and wife Rosalynn have been talking about slowing down his work schedule for many years, now he acknowledged the time had come to begin this process."
],["BBC","French police are questioning Ayoub El-Kahzzani, a 25-year-old Moroccan accused of carrying out Friday's attempted attack on a high-speed Thalys train between Amsterdam and Paris. The suspect, who was restrained and held on the floor by passengers, is said to have links to the 'radical Islamist movement'. He can be held for four days without being charged. Security measures aboard Thalys trains have been stepped up. After a meeting of its national security council on Saturday, Belgium said mixed Franco-Belgian security patrols would be increased on board the Thalys trains, which link major cities in the Netherlands and Belgium to Paris."
],["BBC","A British national being held hostage in Yemen has been released following a military operation, the Foreign Office has announced. Robert Semple was being held by al-Qaeda, the United Arab Emirates state news agency said. He was freed by UAE forces and is 'safe and well', Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. The oil industry worker, in his 60s, is receiving support from British authorities, Mr Hammond added. Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan informed David Cameron on Saturday, the WAM agency said. The Foreign Office has not officially confirmed his name."
],["BBC","The graves were found in the state of Perlis near the Thai border not far from 139 grave sites unearthed in May, Perlis police chief Shafie Ismail said. Authorities believe they may belong to migrants held for ransom in jungle camps by gangs of human traffickers. Migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar have left for Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia recently. Most of the more than 100 bodies found in May belonged to Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in Myanmar. Malaysian police said the latest bodies have been sent for post-mortem examinations."
],["BBC","Ever feel like you too may be working in a ‘bruising workplace’ of the sort alleged at Amazon.com. You know, an office where you live in fear of that ‘question-mark’ email from the big boss or the next horrific run-in you’ll have with a colleague? You’re not alone. But it could be much, much worse. We went to question-and-answer site Quora to find out about some of the worst working conditions readers had experienced. They revealed frustrating and oppressive tales of woe. Tatiana Estevez wrote that she faced aggression and abuse while working in the UK. On her first day at an investment bank, for example, Estevez was informed that if a banker ever wanted to shout and scream at her she should just shut up and take it."
